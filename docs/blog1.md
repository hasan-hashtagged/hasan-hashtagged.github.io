# The Beginning

I sometimes think what brought and will be bringing me here... Is it the sudden emotion struck heart? Is it some mind numbing incident that shatters a "normal" human to question themselves? Is it my fondness to write? or is it the fact that GitHub is offering this beautiful feautre where a tech junkie like me can ramble on as long as they want?

<p>
I have been a reader from the moment I found out the mysterious worlds of writers, biographers and bloggers. But there are things that remain unsaid, unheared and unexpressed no matter who you categorize yourself into: "Introvert", "Extrovert" or "Ambivert".<br>
Is it because you don't want to express what you think? Is it because you don't want them to get hurt by hearing what you wanted to say?
or is it because of the fact that they just ran over you and never gave you a chance to express your thoughts? Well, it is sometimes one of the above that has stopped me. With some people, I prefer to be a "pushover". With some, I don't want to hurt them.<br>
So, let this be a dump to all my random musings and random hours that will be expressed in one form or other.

Let this be the beginning of a wonderful journey(at least for me). I will hope someday this amuses you too.
